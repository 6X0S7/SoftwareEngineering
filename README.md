## COMP1000 - Software Engineering 1
This module exposes students to the principles of software design and construction. The basics of constructing source code to solve a problem will be introduced, exposing students to common control structures alongside concepts such as types and generics. Major programming paradigms such as object orientation and functional programming are introduced. Additionally, key software development tools and methods are explored.

This year we will be using the C and C++ languages. This provides a bottom-up approach to programming which hopefully demystefies some of the concepts met in computer science and programming.

C++ can be thought of as a super-set of the C language. We will start with C, and learn to program with a *procedural* style. We will then build on this and learn about object orientated programming with C++
