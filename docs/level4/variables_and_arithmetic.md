# Variables and Arithmetic

This this session, the objective as follows:

* Store data in local and global variables
* Display variables in the terminal
* Read data from the terminal intput (keyboard) and store
* Use the debugger to inspect and change variable values
* Perform basic arithmetic

## Writing to the Console

Without input or output, a computer cannot fulfill a useful function.

> Philosophically speaking, is a computer actually a computer if it has no input or output? Discuss<sup>**</sup> (max. 2000 words)

> **<sub>Only joking. If you ever hear me ask for an essay, assume I have been abducted by aliens and replaced with a extra-terrestrial imitation.<sub> 

So it is that we cannot begin to learn a programming language without some form of input and output.

### HelloWorld with `puts` (put string)

In this task, we will learn to do two things:

* Open, build and run a lab project  
* Write "strings" to the terminal

| TASK | HelloWorld-101 |
| - | - |
| 1. | Watch this video to see how to open, build and run the HelloWorld-101 task |
| 2. | Replicate what you saw in the video |
| 3. | Modify the code such that the output reads as follows: |
| - | A solution is provided |


```

Hello World

### Watching Variables

### Inspecting Memory

All variables are numbers stored in the  memory of a computer. Whatever **type** of data they are, they all end up stored as binary numbers (grouped together, these make integers) stored in the volatile or persistent memory of the computer.

Some development tools allow us to look inside the computer memory so we can see how the binary data is organised internally.

## The `&` operator

Now we have seen data in memory, you will note once more the two key properties of computer data:

* **address** - this is the *location* of the data in the computer memory. In C and C++, it is always an integer value

* value

### `scanf` (scan formatted)

## Challenges

## Advanced Topics

### Unions

### Bitfields
