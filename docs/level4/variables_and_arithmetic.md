# Variables and Arithmetic

Chris - you are welcome to add some here

## Writing to the Console

Without input or output, a computer cannot fulfill a useful function (is it even a computer at this point?). So it is that we cannot begin to learn a programming language

### Watching Variables

### Inspecting Memory

All variables are numbers stored in the  memory of a computer. Whatever **type** of data they are, they all end up stored as binary numbers (grouped together, these make integers) stored in the volatile or persistent memory of the computer.

Some development tools allow us to look inside the computer memory so we can see how the binary data is organised internally.
