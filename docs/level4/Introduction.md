# Introduction

In this section, we are concerned with setting up our computer, and using the development tools needed for this course.

The choice of tool is discussed so that by the end of this section, as well as learning to use the tools, hopefully you will also begin to be able to *select appropriate software development tools, techniques and environments to aid the implementation of simple software.*

## Aims:

The aims of this section are as follows:

* Install the development tools
* Building and running some code
* Debugging 
* Version control to manage changes
* Appreciate the rationale for using specific tools

## Installing the Software

For this course, we use a combination of the following software:

| Item | Name | Description |
| - | - | - |
| 1. | Integrated Development Environment (IDE) | This is a software tool that allows us to write source code, build executable programs and test |
| | Visual Studio | A complete developer tool that supports multiple languages and frameworks. It is suitable for beginners and experts. It is available for MS Windows and Mac OS (although Mac support is being dropped). Developers can select different options depending on needs. Visual Studio can occupy a considerable amount of disk space, especially if support for a lot of frameworks is needed. It also supports a plug-in architecture to allow it to be extended |
| | Visual Studio Code | This is an open-source cross-platform text editor with a rich plug-in ecosystem. Increasingly it is used as a full IDE. Configuration is not as simple as Visual Studio, and may not always be the best choice for beginners. However, it is available for Windows, Linux (inc. Raspberry Pi), Mac OS and [Web](https://vscode.dev/) |

| Build Tools | Microsoft C/C++ Compiler | This is the tool that converts your code into binary code that a computer understands. The Microsoft Compiler can be installed as part of Visual Studio, or as a separate standalone package |
